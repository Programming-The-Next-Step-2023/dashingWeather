# dashingWeather

dashingWeather (v1.0.0) is a weather app created by Mohammad Hamdan using Dash for Python, for the course "Programming: The Next Step".

This app was built using `Dash` and fetches real time weather information using the free API of `openweathermap.org`. It allows the user to see weather information for any city in the world, including current information, forecasts and maps which can display a number of different weather metrics.

In this repository, you can find:
- `dashingWeather.html`: a user manual
- beta versions of the app in the`beta_versions` folder
- in the `dashingWeather` folder, you can find all necessary files for the app itself, including a `requirements.txt` document and `setup.py`. in the module folder you can find the app code itself (`app.py`) and in the test folder you can find all files necessary for the tests I've conducted.
