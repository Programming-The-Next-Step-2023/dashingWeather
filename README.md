# dashingWeather

I will be creating a weather app for the course "Programming: The Next Step".

This app will be built using `Dash` and will fetch information using the free API of `openweathermap.org`. It will include various funtionalities such as displaying current weather conditions (incl. temperature, humidity, wind speed), as well as a forecast for temperature and rain over the next few days (max up to 5), number of days can be user customized.
